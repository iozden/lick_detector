This program is for recording the times of crossings through two IR sensor independently using an Arduino Due board.
Sensors are connected to DIO pins 31 and 33 respectively. Pin 35 is used for stopping the counts.
The crossing times for each sensor are saved on the SD card mounted on the Arduino board with shield.
