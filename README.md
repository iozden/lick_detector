This program if for counting the number of crossings through two IR sensor independently using an Arduino Due board.
Sensors are connected to DIO pins 31 nad 33 respoectively. Pin 35 is used for stopping the counting.
The crossing times are saved on the SD card mounted on the Arduino board with shield.
